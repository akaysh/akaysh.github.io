I am a graduate student in College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and I am also working as a software developer at Intuit IDC (TurboTax Desktop Team). I did my bachelors (B.Tech) from National Institute of Technology, Karnataka with a major in Information Technology. I like to solve real world problems with computer programming. My interests lie in the field of Artificial Intelligence viz. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I like to contribute to Open Source projects in my free time.

### Resume

Here is the google drive link to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xoARHDJC6wy8iSXX5_2RqAcwA26E5hdw/view?usp=sharing).

### Publications

- I worked on improving a swarm optimisation algorithm during a research internship I got through Indian Academy of Sciences. Avinash Sharma, Akshay Sharma et al. , Ageist Spider Monkey Optimization Algorithm, In: Elsevier Journal, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation June 2016, Pages 58â€“77. Click [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650216000122) for paper link.
I have also implemented the paper in Julia which you can find [here](https://github.com/akaysh/SpiderMonkey.jl).



- I also enhanced the deep learning model based on LSTM and CNN by applying an inner attention mechanism for the LSTM and also used an information retrieval model along with it to generate answers for non factoid questions. Achieved Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of ~0.74 on WikiQA and InsuranceQA datasets. Click [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614034) for paper link.

- I did a poster presentation for my project during my GSoC 2017 intern at JuliaCon 2017 in Berkely, CA. Here is the link for its [write up](https://julialang.org/blog/2017/10/gsoc-NeuralNetDiffEq).
