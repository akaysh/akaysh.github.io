I am a graduate student in College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and I am also working as a software developer at Intuit IDC (TurboTax Desktop Team). I did my bachelors (B.Tech) from National Institute of Technology, Karnataka with a major in Information Technology. I like to solve real world problems with computer programming.

Most of my projects are hosted on [github](https://github.com/akaysh).

When I'm not hacking on code I will most likely be playing football, fiddling with my guitar ,reading a fiction, gaming with my friends or watching some anime.
