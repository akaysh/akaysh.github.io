I'm a software developer from South Birmingham, UK. I've been building web applications for over ten years. Ruby is my language of choice, and vim my editor.

I have a degree in Computer Science from Aberystwyth university. I have worked as a PHP developer in the past before becoming a Ruby on Rails developer. I am currently IT manager for one of the UK's leading online printer ink retailers, Stinkyink.com.

When I'm not hacking on code I will most likely be out riding mountain bikes, taking photos or having a beer with friends and family.

You can contact me via email (or Twitter ) and can view my code / projects on Github.
