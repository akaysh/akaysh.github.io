I am a graduate student in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst doing my Masters with a focus on Machine Learning and NLP. I also worked as a software developer at Intuit IDC (TurboTax Desktop Team) from Aug 2017 to July 2021. I did my bachelors (B.Tech) from the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka with a major in Information Technology. I am an Open Source contributor and my interests like in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I like to solve real-world problems with computer programming.

Most of my projects are hosted on [github](https://github.com/akaysh).

When I'm not hacking on code I will most likely be playing football, fiddling with my guitar, reading fiction, gaming with my friends, or watching some anime.
