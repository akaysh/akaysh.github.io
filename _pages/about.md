I'm a software engineer from India. I am currently working at Intuit IDC. I like to code and experiment with new technologies.

I have a degree in Information Technology from National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. My interests lie in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain.  

Most of my projects are hosted on [github](https://github.com/akaysh).

When I'm not hacking on code I will most likely be playing football, fiddling with my guitar , gaming with my friends or watching some anime.

If our interests match or you just want to say Hi! just drop an email or ping me on twitter. My social networking details are given below my picture.

Thanks for dropping by!
